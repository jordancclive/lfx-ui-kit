🟡 **OBSERVED PATTERN** — Validated by real Board Member, Contributor, Maintainer, and Executive Director dashboards.  
Structure is stable, but role coverage is still expanding.

---

## Purpose

The **Dashboard Pattern** defines how LFX One dashboards are composed to surface
**high-level signals, pending actions, and escalation paths** for different roles.

Dashboards are optimized for:

- Fast scanning
- Minimal cognitive load
- Progressive disclosure
- Clear escalation to drawers and full pages

This is **not a free-form layout**. Dashboards must be assembled from known
sections and primitives to remain predictable and agent-safe.

---

## When to Use

Use the Dashboard Pattern when:

- A role needs a high-level snapshot of system, project, or organizational health
- The primary interaction is **review → drill-down → act**
- Data is time-based, aggregated, or summary-oriented
- The page is not intended for editing or configuration

---

## When NOT to Use

Do **NOT** use the Dashboard Pattern for:

- Data-heavy exploration (use Table Page or Insights)
- Configuration workflows
- Forms or creation flows
- Pages with a single dataset and deep interaction

---

## Canonical Page Structure

All dashboards MUST use the following page frame:

```
AppShell
└─ PageLayout
   ├─ AppHeader
   └─ PageSection (× N)
```

No dashboard may bypass this structure.

---

## Allowed Section Archetypes

Dashboards are composed from **only these section types**.

### 1. Metric Carousel Section

**Purpose:** Surface key quantitative signals at a glance.

**Structure:**

```
PageSection
└─ MetricsRow
   └─ ChartCard (× N)
```

**Rules:**
- Cards are fixed-width and horizontally scrollable
- Charts are sparklines or aggregates only
- Clicking a card opens a **RIGHT-SIDE DRAWER**
- No filters or controls on summary cards

**Escalation:**
- Summary Card → Drawer → Insights

**Used by:**
- Board Member (Foundation Health, My Organization)
- Contributor / Maintainer (Recent Progress)
- Executive Director (Foundation Health, Governance Health)

---

### 2. Action Summary Section

**Purpose:** Show items requiring user attention or decision.

**Structure:**

```
PageSection
├─ SectionHeader (title + View All)
└─ SummaryCard (stacked, × N)
```

**Rules:**
- Cards are equal height
- Typically 2–3 visible
- "View All" escalates to:
  - Drawer (e.g. My Actions)
  - Or full page, depending on role

**Used by:**
- Board Member
- Maintainer
- Executive Director

---

### 3. Meeting Summary Section

**Purpose:** Preview upcoming meetings relevant to the user.

**Structure:**

```
PageSection
├─ SectionHeader (title + View All)
└─ SummaryCard (Meeting)
```

**Rules:**
- Visual height aligns with Action Summary when paired
- Inline "Join" actions when applicable
- "View All" always routes to Meetings page

**Used by:**
- All roles

---

### 4. Table Preview Section

**Purpose:** Provide a lightweight preview of tabular data.

**Structure:**

```
PageSection
├─ TableGrid (preview rows only)
└─ Footer CTA
```

**Rules:**
- Read-only preview
- No sorting, filtering, or pagination
- Escalates to full Table Page

**Used by:**
- Contributor
- Maintainer

---

### 5. Strategic Alert Section (Executive Director Only)

**Purpose:** Surface high-salience risks and recommendations.

**Structure:**

```
PageSection
└─ AlertCard (expandable)
```

**Rules:**
- Higher visual weight than summary cards
- Color encodes urgency
- Expand reveals explanation and recommendation
- Still uses Card primitives (no custom alert system)

---

## Role-Based Composition (Bounded Variations)

Roles may **omit sections**, but must not invent new ones.

| Role | Allowed Sections |
|-----|------------------|
| Board Member | Metric Carousel, Action Summary, Meeting Summary |
| Contributor | Metric Carousel, Action Summary, Table Preview |
| Maintainer | Metric Carousel, Action Summary, Table Preview |
| Executive Director | Metric Carousel, Action Summary, Meeting Summary, Strategic Alerts |

---

## Mapping to UI Kit Components

| Dashboard Element | UI Kit Component |
|------------------|------------------|
| Summary metric card | ChartCard |
| Metric row | MetricsRow |
| Action / Meeting card | SummaryCard |
| Section wrapper | PageSection |
| Section header | SectionHeader |
| Drawer | Drawer |
| Preview table | TableGrid |
| CTA buttons | Button |

No dashboard-specific components are introduced.

---

## Interaction Contracts

- Summary cards never navigate directly
- All summary interactions escalate via **Drawer**
- Drawers may escalate to full pages (e.g. Insights, Meetings)
- Charts follow the **Insights Escalation Contract**

---

## Non-Goals

The Dashboard Pattern does **NOT**:

- Define chart semantics or metrics
- Control routing
- Manage data fetching
- Replace Insights or Table Pages
- Introduce role-specific layout logic

Those responsibilities belong to parent application layers.

---

## Validation Status

- ✅ Board Member dashboard implemented
- ✅ Contributor and Maintainer dashboards implemented
- ✅ Executive Director dashboard implemented
- 🚧 Additional role refinements in progress

This pattern is considered **observed and stable**, pending final canonical lock.
