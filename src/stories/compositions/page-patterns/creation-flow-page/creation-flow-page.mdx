# Creation Flow Page

🚧 **IN PROGRESS**

This is the **authoritative documentation location** for the Creation Flow Page pattern.

The pattern structure is still evolving.
Detailed guidance currently exists in:
- `creation-flow-page.stories.ts`

This MDX file exists to:
- Establish canonical ownership of the pattern
- Prevent parallel documentation
- Enable automated enforcement

Once the pattern is stabilized, all guidance must be consolidated here.
Story files must contain **visual demonstrations only**.
