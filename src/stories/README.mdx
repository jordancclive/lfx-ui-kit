## Purpose of This Storybook

**This Storybook is NOT a component gallery.**

It is a **living reference for a production UI system** that encodes architectural intent, enforces consistency, and supports both human contributors and AI-assisted workflows.

### It exists to:

- Make architectural intent explicit
- Prevent drift and one-off decisions
- Support both human contributors and AI-assisted workflows

### It is optimized for:

- Engineers building new features
- Designers validating implementation
- Product managers understanding constraints
- Technical leadership reviewing architecture
- AI agents working via Cursor / MCP

---

## Architectural Layers

### 1. Components

Reusable building blocks, organized by **composition complexity**:

#### Level 1 — Atoms

Indivisible UI elements that cannot be broken down further.

**Examples:** `Button`, `Tag`, `FilterPill`, `SearchInput`

#### Level 2 — Molecules

Structured patterns built from atoms or adding styled structure.

**Examples:** `Card`, `TableRow`, `TableCell`, `MetricCard`

#### Level 3 — Organisms

Coordinated assemblies that manage multiple Level 1/2 components.

**Examples:** `Table`, `AppHeader`, `AppShell`, `PageLayout`, `MetricsRow`

> **Important:** Levels describe composition complexity, not importance. All levels are production-critical.

---

### 2. Page Patterns

Reusable structural blueprints that define:

- What appears on a page
- Where it appears
- What is allowed vs forbidden

**Examples:** `Table Page` (canonical), `Segmented Table Page` (specialized)

> ✅ **Page Patterns ARE reusable and ARE meant to be copied.**

---

### 3. Page Examples

Concrete product pages showing real usage with product-specific data and logic.

**Examples:** `Dashboard`, `Votes`, `Groups` (via Segmented Table Page)

> ⚠️ **Page Examples are illustrative only and must NOT be copied directly.**  
> Always reference the Page Pattern, not the Example.

## How to Read the Storybook Sidebar

The sidebar is **intentionally ordered** to reflect the architectural flow:

1. **1. Components**  
   → Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3  
   _(Simple → Complex)_

2. **2. Page Patterns**  
   → Reusable blueprints  
   _(What to copy)_

3. **3. Page Examples**  
   → Concrete implementations  
   _(What NOT to copy)_

### Why numeric prefixes exist:

- Storybook sorts alphabetically and by insertion order
- Numeric prefixes enforce architectural intent
- Ordering is intentional and must not be removed

## Design System Philosophy

This UI Kit is built on five core principles:

### Structure before styling
Define what things are before deciding how they look.

### Semantics before visuals
Name things by their meaning, not their appearance.

### Explicitness over inference
Say what you mean. Don't make agents guess.

### Reuse via patterns, not copy-paste
Copy the pattern, not the implementation.

### Strong constraints enable speed
Clear rules reduce decisions and prevent drift.

> _This system is intentionally more explicit than most traditional design systems to support agentic workflows safely._

## The Seven-Step Process Used to Build This UI Kit

This design system was constructed iteratively using a seven-step process:

### 1. Establish token and semantic foundations

Define primitive values (colors, spacing, typography) and semantic aliases that separate intent from implementation.

### 2. Lock component contracts and responsibilities

Document what each component owns, what it does NOT own, and how it binds to tokens.

### 3. Build components bottom-up (Level 1 → 3)

Start with atoms, compose molecules, coordinate organisms. Each level builds on the previous.

### 4. Define reusable page patterns

Extract structural blueprints from real pages. Patterns define WHAT and WHERE, not HOW or WHY.

### 5. Validate patterns using real product examples

Build concrete pages (Dashboard, Votes) to stress-test patterns and identify gaps.

### 6. Encode rules and boundaries as documentation

Write component contracts, pattern docs, and boundary definitions. Documentation is part of the system, not an afterthought.

### 7. Enforce consistency via tooling and automation

Use Storybook ordering, linters, type safety, and agentic workflows to prevent regressions.

> **Important:** These steps are iterative. Changes must respect earlier steps unless explicitly revisited with intention.

## Tooling & Agentic Workflow

This UI Kit was built using a hybrid human-agent workflow:

### Figma
Source of visual intent and design decisions.

### Tokens
Single source of visual truth. All styling flows through tokens.

### Cursor
Implementation and refactoring environment with AI-assisted coding.

### ChatGPT
Reasoning, architecture planning, and documentation generation.

### Figma MCP
Extracting structure and intent from design files.

### Playwright & Chrome MCP
Automated verification, visual regression testing, and real-world validation in production-like environments.

### GitHub
Versioned source of truth with commit-level documentation.

## How This UI Kit Is Maintained

Maintenance follows strict architectural rules:

### New components must declare their level
Is it an atom, molecule, or organism? If unclear, it may not belong.

### New pages must choose a Page Pattern
If no pattern fits, create a new pattern — don't create a one-off page.

### Deviations require explicit justification
Breaking a rule is allowed if documented and intentional.

### Documentation is not optional — it is part of the system
Undocumented components are incomplete. Contracts are requirements, not nice-to-haves.
